## 🩺 Problem Statement

Mental health support faces critical barriers such as:
- Limited availability of professional therapists  
- High costs of therapy sessions  
- Social stigma preventing people from seeking help  
- Lack of 24/7 immediate support  

This project develops an **AI chatbot** that provides accessible, immediate emotional support while recognizing mental health concerns and offering a safe, judgment-free space for expression.

> **Note:** This is not a replacement for professional therapy but serves as a supportive tool.
